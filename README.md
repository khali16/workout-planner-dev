Workout Planner is an app that allows you to plan your training for a given day. After logging in, the user has the option to select a training day in the calendar. He is redirected to a panel where he selects the body part to work on, the type of wourkout, the time to perform it and a link to the video with the exercise or music to make the training more pleasant. Workouts on a given day can be sorted according to the time they were added. If the user has planned workouts, they will be visible from the calendar panel. Firebase (Firestore, Authentication) is responsible for authentication and the database.
